      <h2 class="name">How does this Work?</h2>
      <p class="desc">
        First of all, no gifts please. The best gift you can give is to come and have fun with the game Calvin has prepared.  On February 23rd, you arrive at Calvin and Carolyn's house.  Hopefully, you'll have dressed the part by rumaging thorough your closet or going to the thrift store.  When you come in, Calvin will give you a nametag so that everybody else will know who you are.  This could be helpful in the case that they have information about your character.  Throughout the night, Calvin can answer any questions you might have about how the game works, or clarifying things your character should know.  He may also pull you aside and tell you pivotal information that only you know.  Calvin isn't working with or against anybody, but just trying to help everyone have the most possible fun.
      </p>
      <p class="game-flow">
        The night will mostly run like a normal party.  However, When the party begins, don't start right away.  Calvin will let you know when the time is right.  For the first hour or so, talk and hang out with the other guests.  Grab some food.  Drink some drinks.  At some point, once everyone is there, an announcement will be made that will shake everything up and the game will begin.  From then on, talk to everyone, find out who your friends are and who your enemies are.  If you help someone with their goals, they may help you with yours.  It is up to you achieve your goals by talking and negotiating with people.  The trick is that everyone is will be doing the same.  Are the people you trust lying to you?  Are you lying to them?  There's only one way to find out!
      </p>
      <p class="preparing-tips">
        The reason I'm sending you this large amount of information is so that we can begin playing as soon as possible.  The information below is all about your character; who they are, what they know, and importantly, what they want.  Try to read this all carefully before the party so that you'll be ready to participate right away.  Murder Mystery games work best when the players know the character's they'll be playing well, so here are some tips for being prepared:
        <ul>
          <li>Read all of the information about your character below.  I've actually condensed this down a lot into only the things you need to know.</li>
          <li>Read your goals.</li>
          <li>Read about your character again, this time thinking about your goals.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>...and now, it is time to learn your role!</p>
