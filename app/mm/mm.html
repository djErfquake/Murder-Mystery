      <div class="desc"><p>First of all, no gifts please. The best gift you can give is to come and have fun with the game Calvin has prepared.  On February 23rd, you arrive at Calvin and Carolyn's house.  Hopefully, you'll have dressed the part by rumaging thorough your closet or going to the thrift store.  When you come in, Calvin will give you a nametag so that everybody else will know who you are.  This could be helpful in the case that they have information about your character.</p>
      <p></p></div>
      <div class="game-flow">
        The night will mostly run like a normal party.  For the first hour or so, talk and hang out with the other guests.  Grab some food.  Drink some drinks.  At some point, once everyone is there, an announcement will be made that will shake everything up.  From then on, it is up to you achieve your goals by talking and negotiating with people.  The trick is that everyone is will be doing the same.  Are the people you trust lying to you?  Are you lying to them?  There's only one way to find out!
