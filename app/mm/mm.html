      <p class="desc">
        In order to have the most fun murder mystery experience, it's important to:
        <ol>
          <li>Read about the murder, your character, and how you personally win the game carefully (below)</li>
          <li>Get into character – themed dress and props are encouraged</li>
          <li>Come to the party!</li>
          <li>Once at the party, wait until all the guests arrive and Calvin begins the game to start investigating the murder.  Eat, drink, and by merry until the game starts!</li>
          <li>After the game starts, talk to people – find your friends, enemies, and allies to try and achieve your goals.  Be careful who you trust!  Use Calvin if you have any questions, as he's the game's moderator and not a character.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>Good luck, have fun, and be on the lookout!</p>
